Sometimes you need to analyse every option and optimise everything to the nth degree.  Other times you’d be better off just making a decision and moving forwards even if it isn’t perfect.

The skill is obviously in knowing which is appropriate for your current situation.

If your personality naturally inclines you towards one or the other extreme, consider moving outside your comfort zone a little.  If you are a perfectionist, what is the worst that could happen if you just made the decision now rather than putting it off until you’d done yet more analysis?  Does that risk justify the extra work and extra delay?
