Yes, actually time yourself with a stopwatch.

We constantly estimate how long things will take, mostly subconsciously, and it can be eye-opening to measure how bad our estimates are.

Start by estimating how long a particular task will take. Ideally choose a task in the 0.5 to 2 hours ballpark. Then start your stopwatch and time how long you actually take.

Knowing there is a ticking clock in front of you is a good way to improve focus and avoid distractions, so the times you measure are likely to be better than normal.

[Hofstadterâ€™s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law) often applies.
