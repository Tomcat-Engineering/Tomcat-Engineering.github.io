Start your quest to become a good writer by reading a small book called [“The Elements of Style” by Strunk & White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style).

If you can’t afford [£10 for a paper copy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/020530902X) there seem to be various PDF versions on the internet, although I’m not sure how legal they are.
