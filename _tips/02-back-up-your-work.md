Sooner or later your laptop will spontaneously combust or get left on a train.  Work on the basis that this could happen at any moment.

* Store your actual work in a central location (company server or cloud) rather than having the only copy on your computer.  This also goes for any important data that you have collected.

* Ensure that you can recreate your machine with the minimum of fuss.  I have had complete laptop failures twice, but thanks to the magic of Appleâ€™s Time Machine I could just buy a new computer, plug in my backup disk and in a few hours I had a working computer with all my software, settings and data restored.
