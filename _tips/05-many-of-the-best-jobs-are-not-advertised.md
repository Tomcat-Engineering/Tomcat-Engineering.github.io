Many of the most fun jobs are filled by word of mouth rather than through conventional recruitment.

Advertising a job and interviewing loads of candidates is expensive, time-consuming and often fruitless.  If you already know someone who could do a great, job, why would you bother advertising?

This means that you should:

* Be great at your job, and put the effort in to make sure your boss/customer loves your work (and tells all their friends!).
* Make friends with people you come into contact with through work.
* Never burn your bridges.
* Be proactive about approaching potential employers even if they are not currently advertising a suitable role for you.
