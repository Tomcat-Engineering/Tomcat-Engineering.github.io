[XKCD](https://xkcd.com) is essential weekly reading for geeks.  

Before I went to university someone gave me a book of [Dilbert](https://dilbert.com) cartoons.  I thought they were ok, but assumed that the world could not possibly be like that in real life.  Then I went to work in an engineering office.

Sadly Scott Adams (Dilbert's creator) has become increasingly right wing, and has recently (Feb 2023) been pulled from most American newspapers for saying that he "doesn't want anything to do with black people", so maybe stick to his earlier work!
