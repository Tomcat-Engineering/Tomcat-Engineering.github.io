Sooner or later you will spend time attempting to work out why a system isn’t working. After you’ve poked it a few times and it definitely doesn’t work, start working methodically rather than just randomly changing things in the hope that you will fix it.

See also ["You will forget what you did (part 2)](15-you-will-forget-what-you-did-part-2) about documenting this process.
