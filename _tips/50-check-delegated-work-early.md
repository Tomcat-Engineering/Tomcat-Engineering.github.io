If someone is doing some work for you, it is often worth checking in with them about 10% of the way through the task to check that they have understood the task and havenâ€™t hit any unforeseen problems.

This point is usually far enough in that they have had time to really understand the task and plan their approach, but not too late to redirect them if they have gone off on completely the wrong track.

They might even be able to show you the [outline of the report already](46-write-the-report-first) which is a great way to check that they are heading in the right direction.
