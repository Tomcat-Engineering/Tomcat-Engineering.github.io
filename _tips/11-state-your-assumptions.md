Every piece of engineering is based on assumptions. Write them down clearly at the start of any report.

Unless you are terrible at maths, if someone disputes your results they are probably working from different assumptions. If you havenâ€™t made clear what you assumed then this can result in a long and confusing argument.

Where relevant, check your assumptions with the customer as early as possible.
