Remember Tim Ferris in the [4-Hour Work Week](https://fourhourworkweek.com/) book.  He had an online business and had outsourced his customer service, but got 200 emails a day from the customer service agents asking permission to refund customers, re-ship products, etc.

After spending all his working time responding to these for a while, he considered writing a manual describing how to respond to each situation.  Then he hit on a much simpler solution: he told the agents that if it cost less than $100 to make the customer happy they should just get on with it without contacting him.

200 emails per day became 20 per week, and the customers got much faster responses and better service.  The agents spent much less time writing emails to Tim and probably enjoyed their jobs a lot more.

It feels great to be trusted and given responsibility.  Delegating responsibility can also help to prevent you [becoming a bottleneck](47-dont-be-a-bottleneck).
