Before I went to university someone gave me a book of [Dilbert](https://dilbert.com) cartoons.  I thought they were ok, but assumed that the world could not possibly be like that in real life.  Then I went to work in an engineering office.

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com) is also essential weekly reading for geeks.
