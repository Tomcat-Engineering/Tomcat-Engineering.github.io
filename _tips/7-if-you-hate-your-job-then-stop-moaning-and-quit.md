You only have one life and it may be shorter than you expect.  Don’t waste 8 hours a day doing something you think is pointless.  You can always earn more money later, but you can never get that time back.

When I worked in a large corporation there was a negative vibe, with lots of moaning about the company and the way things were managed.  When I handed in my notice to go and do something more fun, several colleagues came up to me and said “I wish I could do something like that”.   None of them could really explain why they “couldn’t” follow suit, they were just stuck in the mindset that they were going to slog on with their depressing job for the next 30 years.  Don’t do that.
