Several times per day, check that you are actually working on the right task by asking yourself this question:

> If the only thing I complete today is the task I am currently working on, would I be satisfied with my dayâ€™s work?

I read this somewhere and it really does help me to prioritise.  It sounds simplistic and a bit naff, but it often works.  Try it.
