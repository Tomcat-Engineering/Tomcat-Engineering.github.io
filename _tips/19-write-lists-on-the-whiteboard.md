Another time when the whiteboard comes in handy is whenever someone lists more than five things, particularly if the list emerges gradually during the meeting.

You can’t expect everyone to remember all these things, so write them up on the board as they appear. This is often a useful way of conveying to the boss just how many new features they have requested – in their head there are only a few, but once they are written down there is no denying that there are actually fifteen!
