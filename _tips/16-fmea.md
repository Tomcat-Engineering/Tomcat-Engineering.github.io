Learn about “Failure Modes and Effects Analysis” and apply it to your designs.

Spending time considering potential failure modes is always worthwhile. You don’t have to create a big spreadsheet like the formal FMEA process does, though a simplified version of this is actually surprisingly useful on many projects.

Often the most useful ideas to come out of this process are about how you will detect certain failures rather than discovering entirely new failure modes.
