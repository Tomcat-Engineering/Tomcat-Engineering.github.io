Finding and recruiting a good engineer will take far more time and effort than you thought possible.

There doesn’t seem to be a reliable place to search or advertise to find good candidates – though in the software field I have had good results from the [Python job board](https://www.python.org/jobs/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) is also starting to look useful.

Recruitment consultants are generally a ridiculously expensive waste of time.
