We have a small 1970s sailing yacht (a Contessa 26) and sometimes we take a few months off to sail somewhere.

In 2018 we sailed from the UK to Denmark and Sweden.  We left the boat in Denmark over winter and sailed her back to the UK in 2019.

You can read about all these adventures on [our sailing blog](https://sailinglizzie.wordpress.com).
